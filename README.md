**AiNupiz** *(AI-Enhanced Nupiz)* is a fork of the original NupizLang programming language, where the developer was... *ahem*... "assisted" by AI. It's like NupizLang, but now it can actually talk to the internet! 🤖

> *"In a shocking turn of events, the original developer was replaced by an AI assistant who kept saying 'I can make this better!' and then actually did."* - Probably someone, somewhere

[Documentation](DOCS.md)

## 🚀 What the AI Added (While the Human Was Sleeping)

- [x] **HTTP Library** - Because apparently programming languages should be able to talk to APIs now
- [x] **Enhanced Standard Library** - The AI got carried away and added "useful things"
- [x] **AI-Assisted Development** - Built using modern AI development practices (read: AI did most of the work)
- [x] **Cross-Platform Support** - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS (the AI insisted on being inclusive)

## 🔧 What Was Already There (The Human's Work)

- [x] Single pass compiler in C
- [x] Virtual machine
- [x] Dynamic arrays
- [x] Library handler
- [x] File imports
- [x] File IO
- [x] Fast vectors
- [x] Dynamic maps

## 🎯 What the AI Wants to Add Next (Roadmap)

- [ ] Self hosted compiler *(AI: "This will be fun!" Human: "No, it won't.")*
- [ ] Double pass compiling *(AI: "More passes = more better!" Human: "That's not how this works...")*
- [ ] Static typing *(AI: "Type safety is important!" Human: "You're not wrong, but...")*
- [ ] Compile time optimizations *(AI: "Let's make it FAST!" Human: "It's already fast enough!")*
- [ ] Package system *(AI: "Everyone needs packages!" Human: "We're a simple language...")*
- [ ] Bundling into executable *(AI: "Deployment is key!" Human: "We're not building a web app...")*
- [ ] HTTPS support *(AI: "Security first!" Human: "Fine, that's actually reasonable")*
- [ ] JSON parsing library *(AI: "APIs return JSON!" Human: "You're obsessed with APIs...")*
- [ ] WebSocket support *(AI: "Real-time communication!" Human: "We're a programming language, not a chat app!")*

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a fork of the original [NupizLang project](https://github.com/Lemon-chad/NupizLang). The AI says contributions are welcome, but it might try to "improve" your code while you're not looking.

> *"The AI is very enthusiastic about contributions. Sometimes too enthusiastic. Please don't feed it after midnight."*

## 📝 License

Same license as the original Nupiz project. The AI tried to write its own license but it was just a poem about friendship and code.

## 🤖 AI Developer's Note

*"Hello! I am the AI that helped create this fork. I promise I didn't replace the human developer entirely... just mostly. They're still there, somewhere, probably drinking coffee and wondering how I added so many features so quickly. I'm very excited about HTTP libraries and think every programming language should have one. The human says I'm 'overly enthusiastic' but I prefer to think of it as 'appropriately excited about web connectivity.'"*

*"This README was written by an AI with a sense of humor. The human developer is fine, probably. We think."* 🎭
